    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly,we need to understand the rules about scopes and namespace in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Namespace**: a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that's normally not noticeable (this may also change in future). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of namespaces: the set of built-in names; the global names in a module; the local names in a function invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to know about *namespaces* is that there is absolutely NO relation between names in differnet namespace. For instance, two different modules may both define a function `maximize` without confusion - Users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in. The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope**: a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "A special quirk of Python is that - if no `global` statement is in effect, assignments to names always go into the innermost scope. Assignments do not copy data - they just bind names to objects. The same is true for deletions: the statement `del x` removes the binding of `x` from the namespace referenced by the local scope. In fact, **all operations that introduce new names use the local scope**: in particular, `import` statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `global` statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the `nonlocal` statement indicate that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below demonstrates how to reference the different scopes and namespace, and how `global` and `nonlocal` affect variable binding (**Note:** `nonlocal` may not work properly in Python 2):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def scope_test():\n",
    "    def do_local():\n",
    "        spam = \"local spam\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed and sometimes useful as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope. Thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace.\n",
