    "## Basic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of regular expressions is that they can specify patterns, not just fixed characters. Here are the most basic patterns which match single chars:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a, X, 9, <** -- ordinary characters just match themselves exactly. The meta-characters which do not match themselves because they have special meanings are: . ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \\ | ( ) (details below)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **. (a period)** -- matches any single character except newline '\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\w** -- (lowercase w) matches a \"word\" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Note that although \"word\" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word. \\W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\b** -- boundary between word and non-word\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\s** -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \\n\\r\\t\\f]. \\S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\t, \\n, \\r** -- tab, newline, return\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\d** -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support but \\d, but they all support \\w and \\s)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **^** = start, **$** = end -- match the start or end of the string\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\** -- inhibit the \"specialness\" of a character. So, for example, use \\. to match a period or \\\\ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \\@, to make sure it is treated just as a character."
